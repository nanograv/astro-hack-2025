                  This hack-week will serve as a loosely-structured opportunity for collaborative work on AstroWG related projects, for example holodeck, and calculations for the upcoming PFC3 proposal.  We envision that each day we will have some group discussion, a couple of brief presentations, and mostly open work time where people can self-organize into collaborative- or independent- work.

                  Please sign-up using the link above (<i>includes 'maybe' option</i>), which can also be used for coordinating shared hotel rooms.  We are asking for a <i>registration fee of $50/person</i> for NANOGrav members, which is being supplemented by the NANOGrav PFC to cover coffee, snacks, lunches (Wed+Thur), and the group dinner (Thur).  If costs of travel, or the registration fee, are an obstacle to any attendees, <u>please reach out</u> to Luke Kelley as there may be some limited funding available to assist.

            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p>
              <b>Flights:</b> the UC Berkeley campus is located right next to downtown Berkeley.  Getting to Berkeley is very easy from either <u>San Francisco International Airport</u> (SFO; more/cheaper flights) or <u>Oakland International Airport</u> (OAK; a little faster/easier).  San Jose International Airport (SJC) is also not bad, but requires a few transfers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Local:</b> campus, and the local area, are both very easily accessible via both <u>BART light-rail</u> and <u>AC Transit Bus</u>.  You can pay for both using a <a href="https://www.bart.gov/tickets">Clipper Card or Clipper phone app</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Hotels:</b> the best local hotel for visiting campus is the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/GHf5Lkqn1YApJHKa9">Residence Inn Downtown Berkeley</a>, which is right next to campus and also the Downtown Berkeley BART station.  The <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/B6TKJdxfZo88w4Wm6">Hotel Shattuck Plaza</a> is just around the corner (but I can't personally vouch for it).  Some cheaper, still good options are the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/muEbaiR3qGNvH2268">Graduate (Hilton)</a> (also right next to campus), and the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/yG1a4zmrK5aPBSzP7">Aiden (Best Western)</a> which is an easy ~10 minute bus ride away.
              <br>
              <i>NOTE: There are a number of other options on University Avenue, running west from campus; unfortunately, many of them are a bit run-down, and may be in uncomfortable areas.</i>
